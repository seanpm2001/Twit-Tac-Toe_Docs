## Settings

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the settings section</b></p></summary>

The game has some built-in settings. For example, you can change the wallpaper/make it change wallpapers after each round, change the player logos, add a time limit, keep/manage scores, and set usernames. 

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the built-in background images section</b></p></summary>

### Built-in background images

If `wallpaperOn` equals `true` and `wallpaperTransitions` is equal to `true` you will be able to see 3 different wallpapers upon each game ending. If you change `backgroundNumLimit` to 4 or higher, the game will look for additional wallpapers. If they are not found, it will default to the first one. If you set the value to 1, wallpapers will never transition. If you set the value to 0 or lower, the game will load the background as solid black (or white, depending on your system theme of dark or light) changing `BackgroundNum` will change the background, although the game will do this on its own.

## About page

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the about page section</b></p></summary>

The about page currently can only be called in the console while the about page is active by typing `A` or `ABOUT` it will run at the start of launching the program, but has not yet been programmed to run outside of this.

</details>

## Game status

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the game status section</b></p></summary>

The game operates with a string called `game` which always has one of these 6 values:

- `new` - This is the start of a new game.
- `ongoing` - The current game is ongoing
- `X Won` - Player 2 (X) won by getting 3 in a row.
- `O Won` - Player 1 (O) won by getting 3 in a row.

## Default players

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the default players section</b></p></summary>

The game has 2 default players, which can be altered (currently only through simple source code modification) the 2 default players are:

## Other languages

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the other languages section</b></p></summary>

I will test this game in other programming languages in the future when it is deemed necessary.

</details>

## Programming goals

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the programming goals section</b></p></summary>

The goal is to have the program written in 140 lines or less. This number is in reference to the previous Twitter character limit. It should be less than 100, I will optimize it further as I go.
